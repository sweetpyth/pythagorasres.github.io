            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am known as Pythagoras in the Crypto space, but my real name is Stelios, and I am from Greece.
                In my free time, I enjoy learning new skills that will benefit my future self.<br><br>
                With over two years of experience in the Crypto space, I have gained significant knowledge, though I am always eager to learn more.
                My strong qualification is my ability to engage with people, which initially led me to work as a moderator.
                Over time, I transitioned into a Community Manager role for various projects.
                I believe that to excel in your work, you must care about the community even more than yourself.
